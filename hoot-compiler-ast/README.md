### Hoot Compiler Library

Contains the ANTLR grammar and language element classes for the Hoot Smalltalk compiler.

| **Package** | **Contents** |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| Hoot Compiler Constants   | Hoot Smalltalk language literals: numbers, arrays, string, symbols |
| Hoot Compiler Expressions | Hoot Smalltalk language expressions |
| Hoot Compiler Notes  | Hoot Smalltalk language annotations and decorations |
| Hoot Compiler Parser | Hoot Smalltalk parser generated by ANTLR |
| Hoot Compiler Scopes | Hoot Smalltalk language scopes: blocks, methods, signatures, faces, files |

To improve potential integration with [GraalVM][graal-vm] and [Truffle][truffle], 
the AST nodes have been separated out from the remaining compiler.
